abstract: "The HLTCOE participated in the entity linking and slot filling tasks at TAC 2009. A machine learning-based approach to entity linking, operating over a wide range of feature types, yielded good performance on the entity linking task. Slot-filling based on sentence selection, application of weak patterns and exploitation of redundancy was ineffective in the slot filling task."
