abstract: "We describe our entry in the CoNLL-X shared task. The system consists of three phases: a probabilistic vine parser (Eisner and N. Smith, 2005) that produces unlabeled dependency trees, a probabilistic relation-labeling model, and a discriminative minimum risk reranker (D. Smith and Eisner, 2006). The system is designed for fast training and decoding and for high precision. We describe sources of crosslingual error and ways to ameliorate them. We then provide a detailed error analysis of parses produced for sentences in German (much training data) and Arabic (little training data)."
